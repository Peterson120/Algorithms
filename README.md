<h1> Welcome to my package of Algorithms</h1>
<body> I don't know why you're here considering there are many other better algorithm packages with improved formatting and faster complexities but I guess you are welcome to use anything in here. 
<br></br>
Quick note: It is not recommended to use string sorting if time or space is important(Takes almost 10x as long as int or char Sorting)</body>
