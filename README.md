<h1> Welcome to my package of Algorithms</h1>
<body> I don't know why you're here considering there are many other better algorithm packages with improved formatting and faster complexities but I guess you are welcome to use anything in here. 
<br></br>
Quick note: It is not recommended to use string sorting if time or space is important(Takes almost 10x as long as int or char Sorting)</body>

<h3>Legend</h3>
(Finished): Completely Finished Package with support for arrays and lists
<br></br>

<br></br>
(Unfinished): Algorithm is in progress
<br></br>
CompareStrings is used to map characters to values for String comparisons
<br></br>
Tester is the main driver code
<br></br>
BogoSort is the best sorting algorithm ever! Use when possible

<h2>Run Code</h2>
Clone the code to your local machine
Then Run 
   javac *.java && java Tester
